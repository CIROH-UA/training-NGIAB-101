  The NGIAB 101 training module, developed by the
  Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in
  Hydrology (CIROH), offers an introductory, hands-on
  learning experience with NextGen In A Box (NGIAB)â€”a
  modular, open-source hydrologic modeling framework. This

  workflow, including installation, data preparation, model
  execution, evaluation, and visualization. It also provides
  optional advanced topics for high-performance computing
  (HPC) environments.
