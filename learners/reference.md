## Glossary

- Modeling Terms
  - National Water Model (NWM)
    - Hydrologic model used operationally by NOAA's National Weather Service to provide hydroloigc predictions for over 3.4 million rivers and streams across the United States
  - Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen)
    - An advancement of the NWM, a standards-based and model-agnostic modular set of software tools that applies the Basic Model Interface
  - NextGen in a Box (NGIAB)
    - An open-source, containerized solution that encapsulates the NextGen framework and essential modeling components into a self-contained, reproducible application
  - Data Preprocess
    - A tool to streamline data preparation for NextGen simulations
  - Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research (TEEHR)
    - A Python-based package enabling iterative and explorative analysis of hydrologic model performance
  - Data Visualizer
    - A tool that provides a robust environment for geospatial and time series visualization of catchments and nexus points
  - Forcings
    - External inputs that drive a model
  - t-route
    - Channel routing model

- Computing Terms
  - Containerization
    - Encapsulating applications, their dependencies, and runtime environments into a single, portable unit to address compatibility issues and hardware variation challenges
  - Docker
    - A widely used containerization platform that provides a lightweight, portable, and scalable solution for software deployment
  - Singularity
    - A containerization platform for HPC environments
  - Basic Model Interface (BMI)
    - A standardized system designed to enhance interoperability between models and datasets
  - Tethys Platform
    - Platform for geospatial web app development
  - High-Performance Computing (HPC)
    - Systems with clusters of parallel processors that process data and perform calculations at high speeds
  - Job scheduler (e.g. SLURM/PBS/LSF)
    - A software that manages which tasks run where and when on an HPC system
  - Open-source
    - Software or data that is publicly accessible and can be redistributed or modified
  - Secure Shell (SSH)
    - Network protocol that provides secure remote access with encrypted connections
- Hydrologic Terms
  - Catchment
    - Area from which precipitation collects and drains into an output point like a river or water body. Also known as a watershed
  - Streamflow
    - The flow of water in a channel, measured in units of volume/time (e.g. cubic meters per second (CMS), cubic feet per second (CFS))
  - Hydrologic simulation
    - A computer-based replication of the natural water cycle
  - CONUS (Continental United States)
    - Refers to the 48 contiguous states and D.C.
