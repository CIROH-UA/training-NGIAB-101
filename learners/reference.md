## Glossary

- National Water Model (NWM)
  - Hydrologic model used operationally by NOAA's National Weather Service to provide hydroloigc predictions for over 3.4 million rivers and streams across the United States
- Next Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework (NextGen)
  - An advancement of the NWM, a standards-based and model-agnostic modular set of software tools that applies the Basic Model Interface
- NextGen in a Box (NGIAB)
  - An open-source, containerized solution that encapsulates the NextGen framework and essential modeling components into a self-contained, reproducible application
- Containerization
  - Encapsulating applications, their dependencies, and runtime environments into a single, portable unit to address compatibility issues and hardware variation challenges
- Docker
  - A widely used containerization platform that provides a lightweight, portable, and scalable solution for software deployment
- Singularity
  - A containerization platform for HPC environments
- Data Preprocess
  - A tool to streamline data preparation for NextGen simulations
- Tools for Exploratory Evaluation in Hydrologic Research (TEEHR)
  - A Python-based package enabling iterative and explorative analysis of hydrologic model performance
- Data Visualizer
  - A tool that provides a robust environment for geospatial and time series visualization of catchments and nexus points
