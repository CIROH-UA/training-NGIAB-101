## DevCon 2025 NGIAB Workshop Instructors
We have prepared two DevCon-specific documents for you. [DevCon 2025 Jetstream Instructions](/training-NGIAB-101/devcon25js.html) will walk learners through the specific steps we will take in this hands-on workshop. [DevCon 2025 Troubleshooting](/training-NGIAB-101/troubleshooting.html) contains useful reference material for learners if they are stuck during the workshop. 

## Other Instructors
Feel free to skip around this module based on learner backgrounds and use cases. The [Introduction episode](/training-NGIAB-101/introduction.html) contains heavy text-based exposition that may not be engaging in a hands-on workshop environment. The [Advanced Topics episode](/training-NGIAB-101/advanced-topics.html) is optional for most learners, but you may want to highlight specific sections depending on your audience.
