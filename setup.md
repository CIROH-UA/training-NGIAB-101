Welcome to the NGIAB 101 training module!

To dive right into NextGen in a Box (NGIAB) as quickly as possible, follow the quick start guide on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra), or head straight to our second episode, Installation. 

If you are interested in taking your time and learning in-depth about the features of NGIAB, follow the episodes in this module. 

Technical modeling, computing, and hydrologic terms are defined in the [Glossary](/site/docs/reference.html) (accessible from the top toolbar of the online site) for your reference.

Note: This module requires you to use Bash scripting in your command line and Git. All commands will be given in this module. However, if you are interested in learning more, you can refer to this [quick Bash tutorial by Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), [this basic Git tutorial in the Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial), and this [Git workflow tutorial by CIROH](https://github.com/AlabamaWaterInstitute/data_access_examples/blob/main/doc/GIT_USAGE.md).
